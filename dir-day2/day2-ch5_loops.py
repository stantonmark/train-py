#in this exercise you will create a number guess game. It will prompt the user to guess the magic number between 1 and 10. If the user guesses correctly, it will print a winner
#message and exit. If the user guesses incorrectly, he/she will be prompted again. The user
#will be given three go's after which, if he/she has not guessed correctly the script will
#print a loser message.
#1. Create a script named ch5_loops.py.
#2. Import the random module as follows:
#import random
#3. Declare and assign a variable as follows:
#magic_number = random.randint(1, 10)
#4. Code a loop that iterates three times.
#5. Inside the loopâ€¦
#a. Prompt the user to input a guess and capture it in a variable named
#user_guess.
#b. If the user's guess equals the magic number, print a winner message to the
#console and break out of the loop.1
#c. If the user's guess does not equal the magic number, print an appropriate
#message, e.g. too low or too high.8
#6. If the loop exits normally, the user has not guessed correctly so print a suitable
#consolation message to the console.

import random
magic_number = random.randint(1,10)
for number in range(3):
    user_guess = int(input('guess the magic number between 1 and 10:'))
    if user_guess == magic_number:
        print("you are a winner")
        break
    elif user_guess < magic_number:
        print('your guess is too low')
    elif user_guess > magic_number:
        print('your guess is too high')
