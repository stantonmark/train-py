#Â expression involves operators and operands 

#% is the floor divisin  so 10 // 3 is how many times 3 goes into 10 

# 10 modulus 3 = 1 as it calculates the remained whne the first number is deivided into the second 
# 10 divided by 3 is 3 and 1 left over 

#  10 // 3 is ten divided by three which is three, it rounds down t teh nearest numebr
